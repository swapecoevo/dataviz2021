For my first Shiny app, I used a check box group user interface and plotted data from my undergrad thesis. This data evaluated the performance of 3 species of duckweed with multiple densities of aphids over time, and I wanted to see if I could check off the number of aphids to do pairwise comparisons of each density of aphids (e.g. compare the control of zero aphids to each density at a time). I would eventually like to do more than just one checkbox group, and incorporate the aphid density data on each species of duckweed into this shiny plot so that one could simultaneously see the aphid density and corresponding duckweed performance, and could see the interesting result I found of the aphid density going to a certain number on each species regardless of the starting number. That would be really cool to visualize together!
